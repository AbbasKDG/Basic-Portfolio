                        <p>A lot more content is to be displayed here which would constitute the mass and bulk of text on this page, relating to myself and areas of interest to potential readership of this dummy page. This page, while built on the mentality of a wireframe,  was fleshed out and finally and successfuly implemented as the recommeneded assignment.
                        After a number of iterations the need for frameworks such as bootstrap becomes apparent to the designer. The need to create a new template with its unique nuances and quirks and having to fine tune these for every occassion while educational soon devolves into a frustrating exercise.</p>

    <!-- Instructions
3 HTML documents: index.html, contact.html and portfolio.html.
A folder called assets.
Inside the assets directory, make two additional folders: css and images.


The main logo where it says "Your Name" should say your name. 
This may make the logo section smaller or wider depending on how
 long your name isâ€”that is fine and expected.

 Be sure to validate your html.


 Teal color (used for headings and backgrounds): #4aaaa5

Regular font color (used for paragraphs and all text besides the headings): #777777

Main header background color: #ffffff

Main header border color: #cccccc

Footer background color: #666666

Main content background color: #ffffff

Main content border color: #dddddd

For heading fonts use font-family: 'Georgia', Times, Times New Roman, serif;.
For all other fonts use 'Arial', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;.

The background pattern used was found on Subtle Patterns. You can browse through
 that site and find whichever pattern you like.

 The entire content and the main section content area is 960px wide.
Pro-tip: Use the Page Ruler extension to measure the size of elements.

Don't forget to look into these concepts: float, padding, margin, 
display, overflow, clear and text-align.
